# my_bash_scripts

These are some scripts that I have created by using skills that I've learned from school, books, courses, and researching or looking up what I don't know.

My sources include Google searches (stack overflow, etc..).

You are more than welcome to download, modify, and use these scripts. 

Remember to do your due diligence and read the source code.
