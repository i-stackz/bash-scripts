# my_bash_scripts

I am a newbie and I am looking to learn and practice bash scripting and programming.

These are some scripts that I have created by using things that i've learned in class and by looking up what I don't know and adapting/modiying them to my needs. 

my sources are google searches (stack overflow, etc,).

you are more than welcome to download, modify, and use these scripts. 

read the source code.
